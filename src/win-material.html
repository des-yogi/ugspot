Whether you choose double or triple glazing, both offer excellent thermal insulation and noise reduction, making your home more comfortable and energy-efficient year-round. For enhanced performance, our glazing units can be filled with argon gas, an inert gas that increases thermal efficiency by reducing heat transfer through the glass. Argon-filled windows also help to reduce condensation buildup and improve overall energy savings, ensuring a warm, comfortable environment while lowering energy bills. For character properties or listed buildings where replacing the original windows is not possible, secondary glazing units are the ideal solution. They preserve the exterior charm while significantly improving insulation and noise reduction. To learn more, visit our Secondary Glazing Unit page for more details on how this can be the perfect upgrade.</p>
