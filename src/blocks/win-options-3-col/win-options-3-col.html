    <p>* Energy Rating show overall energy efficiency of the product. The entire window (the frame and the glass) is assessed to allow for heat loss, draughts and solar gain, giving a rating that indicates the overall impact of fitting that window in your home.
      *The R Value Measures resistance to heat gain or loss. Example, a typical insulated wall has an R-value anywhere from 12 to 19.</p>
    <p>* The U Value of the glass tells us heat loss through the glass, the glass edge and the frame.</p>
    <p>* The G Value of the glass tells us how well the glass transmits heat from the sun.</p>

          <p>At UGS Ltd, we offer a variety of glazing options for our uPVC windows to enhance energy efficiency, security, and comfort in your home. Our windows are available with either double or triple glazing, providing superior insulation and reducing energy costs.</p>
          <p><strong>Double Glazing</strong>: A popular option, double glazing consists of two glass panes with a gap between them, which significantly reduces heat loss, helps with soundproofing, and enhances overall security.</p>

        <div class="win-options-3-col__option-text">
            <p>Both our double and triple glazing units can be filled with Argon gas, which is denser than air. This gas filling provides additional insulation by reducing heat transfer through the glass, helping to maintain a consistent temperature in your home. Argon-filled glazing improves energy efficiency, lowers heating bills, and reduces the carbon footprint of your home, making it an environmentally friendly option. For character properties or homes in conservation areas where changing the original windows is not allowed, secondary glazing offers the perfect solution. It provides the benefits of improved insulation and noise reduction without altering the external appearance of your property. Feel free to visit our Secondary Glazing Units page for more details on this option.</p>
