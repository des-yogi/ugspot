    <div class="win-options-3-col__add-text">
      <p>When shopping for new windows and doors, many people face the challenge of choosing between double or triple glazing. If you’re not well-versed in window technology, it can be hard to understand the differences or whether an extra pane of glass truly offers significant advantages.</p>
      <p>The double-glazed windows and doors deliver exceptional performance, with a U-value of 1.2W/m²K and a sound reduction of 37dB as standard, along with a centre pane U-value of 1.0W/m²K. Current building regulations require a minimum U-value of 1.6W/m²K, which means our double glazing exceeds performance expectations.</p>
      <p>However, you might still be considering triple glazing. One reason for choosing triple glazing could be the overall SAP (Standard Assessment Procedure) calculations on a new build or when extending a property, as certain energy efficiency standards must be met. UGS Ltd. is committed to meeting these requirements with the most cost-effective solutions. Rather than offering a higher-performing triple-glazed unit with a U-value of 0.9W/m²K at a premium cost, we focus on long-term customer benefits. In many cases, the extra investment in such an upgrade might be better allocated to other aspects of the build.</p>

    <p>* Energy Rating show overall energy efficiency of the product. The entire window (the frame and the glass) is assessed to allow for heat loss, draughts and solar gain, giving a rating that indicates the overall impact of fitting that window in your home.
      *The R Value Measures resistance to heat gain or loss. Example, a typical insulated wall has an R-value anywhere from 12 to 19.</p>
    <p>* The U Value of the glass tells us heat loss through the glass, the glass edge and the frame.</p>
    <p>* The G Value of the glass tells us how well the glass transmits heat from the sun.</p>

        <div class="win-options-3-col__option-text">
            <p>Both our double and triple glazing units can be filled with Argon gas, which is denser than air. This gas filling provides additional insulation by reducing heat transfer through the glass, helping to maintain a consistent temperature in your home. Argon-filled glazing improves energy efficiency, lowers heating bills, and reduces the carbon footprint of your home, making it an environmentally friendly option. For character properties or homes in conservation areas where changing the original windows is not allowed, secondary glazing offers the perfect solution. It provides the benefits of improved insulation and noise reduction without altering the external appearance of your property. Feel free to visit our Secondary Glazing Units page for more details on this option.</p>
