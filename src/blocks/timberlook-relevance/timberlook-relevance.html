        <p>When developing the Timber-look glazing system, careful attention was given to the Article 4 Conservation Area Guidelines for Windows. By combining these principles with modern technology and cost-effective materials, we have created secure, energy-efficient products that retain the traditional charm of period properties.</p>
        <p>Local authorities are increasingly approving Timber-Look Flush Sash Windows for use in conservation areas and listed buildings. More and more councils recognise their authentic appearance, acknowledging that they successfully replicate traditional flush casements while maintaining key heritage details such as the cill and trickle ventilation. Their design ensures a seamless blend of classic aesthetics with modern performance, making them a preferred choice for heritage projects.</p>

        <h3 class="timberlook-relevance__subtitle">New Build Projects</h3>
        <p>When selecting windows and doors for a new-build property, they must comply with current building regulations, whether for a single home or a larger development.</p>
        <p>Timber-look windows meet Document Q standards, having undergone independent testing. With enhanced glass and hardware, they are also PAS24 certified, ensuring they meet security requirements set by building inspectors.</p>
        <p>As these are separate standards, if not installed by UGS Ltd, it is essential to discuss them with your local installer when specifying your project.</p>
